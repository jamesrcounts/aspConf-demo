#Unit Testing ASP.NET MVC Views with ApprovalTests

## How Hard Can It Be? | aspConf 2012 | 7/22/2012

If you missed it, aspConf happened July 17-18, 2012.  I presented a demo of the MVC View testing technique I've written about on this blog. My session was July 18 from 1-2:15 PM PST in Room 3.  If you missed the live show, I hope you will watch the screencast now posted on channel9.  Don't miss the next aspConf (I presume next year), it’s a virtual, on-line conference and it’s free!  You don’t even have to get out of your chair.

Here are a few resources for the talk including the screencast mentioned above:
